This repository contains the code for the nUSD stablecoin project. The nUSD stablecoin is backed by ETH and allows users to deposit ETH and receive nUSD in return. It also provides a redeem function to convert nUSD back into ETH. The project includes a Solidity smart contract, a basic UI, and tests.
